# Credit Default Prediction — Machine Learning Project (ESILV 2025)

>  **Note:** This version is functional but not final. Several improvements (feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, SHAP explainability) will be added later.

## Project Description
This project aims to predict whether a client will default on a loan using the **Home Credit Default Risk** dataset from Kaggle.  
The notebook includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, model selection, class imbalance strategies, ensemble methods, and evaluation metrics.

## Course Alignment (ESILV Machine Learning — N. Mellouli)
This project follows the concepts studied in:
- **Lesson 1:** Data Preprocessing  
- **Lesson 3:** Imbalanced Learning  
- **Lesson 5:** Decision Trees  
- **Lesson 6:** Ensemble Learning & Grid Search
